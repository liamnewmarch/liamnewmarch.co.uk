title: Start unique and drop the “the” – my thoughts on URLs
layout: post

A few weeks ago, the [Guardian][guardian-link] newspaper switched from _guardian.co.uk_ to _theguardian.com_ as part of the paper re–branding itself as a global media outlet.

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with them changing their TLD. As a user of their site it doesn’t make much difference to me how the URL ends – address autocompletion in Chrome means I don’t have to remember. The problem is they also added a _“the”_.

How unique the beginning of your URL is matters because it means less characters to type. Consider the webcomic [xkcd][xkcd-link] – thanks to my browsing history, my Chrome omnibox automatically suggests it after only typing _“x”_. I don’t think I visit another site beginning with x. At the very worst, if I were to start frequenting another site beginning with x, I might have to type _“xk”_, which is almost guaranteed to be unique – a good choice by Randall Munroe.

If the website in question has a more generic name, a good mitigation technique is to have multiple entry points. Going back to the Guardian for example, the old _guardian.co.uk_ URL still works, meaning I can type _“gu”_ to access the site, rather than compete with other websites beginning with _“the”_. On it’s own _“g”_ for me returns _gmail.com_ – despite the canonical URL is [mail.google.com][gmail-link]. Typing _“gmail”_ is habit for me, but it also helps against collisions with URLs beginning with _“mail”_.

I find myself using non-canonical URLs like that a lot, particularly for google services. I use _music.google.com_ _(“mu”)_, _calendar.google.com_ _(“ca”)_ and _analytics.google.com_ _(“an”)_ instead of [play.google.com/music][google-music-link], [google.com/calendar][google-calendar-link] and [google.com/analytics][google-analytics-link], respectively.

Out of interest, I went through my keyboard to see which site is suggested for each single character. I only had two sites bound to number keys – [127.0.0.1][localhost-link] and [24ways.org][24ways-link]. I also had nothing in my browser for q – I guess if you want to be smart about your startup’s omnibox URL autocompletion, you should register a domain beginning with 0, 3—9 or q.
