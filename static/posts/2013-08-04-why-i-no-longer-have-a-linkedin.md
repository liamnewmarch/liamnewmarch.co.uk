title: Why I no longer have a LinkedIn

“Are they having sex or aren’t they?” That was (according to The Social Network) the motivation behind Facebook; the question they thought they could help their users answer. Lately I’ve been trying to boil LinkedIn down and I’ve got to ask – what purpose does it serve?

I suppose the elevator pitch for LinkedIn could be something like: “an online directory of everyone’s current employment status, their connections and their CV/resumé.” On paper that sounds promising, useful even. In practice though, there are a few things I don’t like about the professional social network.

## Endorsements are broken

Anyone can endorse anyone else’s skills, which is a fundamental flaw. The first person to endorse me for one of my skills was my dad, then a friend I went to University with, then a guy I hadn’t talked to in years and so on. If anyone can endorse anyone else for anything then what this becomes is not a system of identifying people’s strengths, but a game of who can play LinkedIn the best. The winner in all this is LinkedIn, not recruiters, and certainly not the users.

## Voluntary spam

Recruiters are rife on LinkedIn. Don’t get me wrong, I think recruiters are very useful in helping you find work that you might not have time to look for yourself, but that is a process that works when _you_ approach the recruiter. For LinkedIn, recruiters can contact you whether you want them to or not. This is a problem that plagues a lot of the online job database type services but LinkedIn (in my experience) is by far the worst.

## Breaking the multiple notification rule

No social network should ever notify you twice about the same event; that is a rule I’ve come up with specifically because of how LinkedIn handles connections. Sending me an email about something I didn’t do the week before and telling me that so-and-so are “waiting” is… well, obnoxious.

## Duplicate CVs

When I was trying to decide whether to keep my account or not, I weighed up turning off all notifications (which were really starting to irritate me) to see what functionality was left. It dawned on me that without the connections and endorsements and messaging, LinkedIn is most useful as an online CV.

For a lot of people it is useful to have an easily-updatable online CV, but I am a web developer. I already have an [online CV][cv-link]. All things considered then, do I really need a LinkedIn account as well? I decided [no][linkedin-link].
