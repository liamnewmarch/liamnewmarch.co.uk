This year is my father’s 50th birthday. To celebrate we’re attempting the
[Coast to Coast Walk][coast-to-coast] which will take us across the England,
from Whitehaven in Cumbria to Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire.

The two hundred mile journey was first popularised by
[Alfred Wainright][wainwright] and should take us fourteen days. During
this time we will pass through three national parks: the Lake District, the
Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors.

A long standing tradition is take a pebble from one beach and carry it with you
to other side. We’ll be setting off on the 1st of September with the hope of
reaching the Eastern shore on his birthday, the 14th.
