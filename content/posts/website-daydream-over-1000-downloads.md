$title: Website Daydream – over 1,000 downloads

My Android app [Website Daydream][play-link] recently passed a landmark 1,000 downloads!

In celebration of this milestone I’ve started planning out version 2.0. There are some new features I’d like to add, as well as giving the projected a bit of a visual overhaul. All-in-all I hope to make the app more useful for custom dock-screens without sacrificing simplicity.

What I’d like to know is – are there any features you'd like to see added to Website Daydream? Let me know in the comments.
