Promises are making a big splash in the JavaScript world. They are a way of
handling _asynchronous logic_ in a way that avoids nested callbacks. In this
post I hope to explain why Promises are useful, and how you can start using
them today.


## Browser support

Promises are being finalised as part of the latest and greatest version of
JavaScript called ECMASCript 6 (or ES6 if you’re cool). Native browser
support isn’t great but there is out of the box support in Chrome 32+ and
Firefox 29+.

For projects that _have to_ run on other browsers Jake Archibald has you
covered with the [ES6 Promise][es6-promise] polyfill. Include it on a page
and you can use the proper ES6 Promise syntax on old devices. Beautiful.


## Before Promises

Okay, so what do I mean by _asynchronous logic_? I’m talking about a function
call that sets up a listener or callback for something that will happen in
the future.

This could be anything that takes time. We could be waiting for the DOM to
load, AJAX requests to return, animations to complete, timers to finish, even
user interaction. In short, anything that we would use a callback function for.

Traditional JavaScript callbacks work very well up to a point, but we run into
problems when we're waiting for multiple conditions to be met. Anyone who has
used Node.js will be familiar with the concept of callback hell:


    waitForConditionOne(function() {
      waitForConditionTwo(function() {
        waitForConditionThree(function() {
          waitForConditionFour(function() {
            waitForConditionFive(function() {
              // All conditions are met, run my code now
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });


The callback pyramid is ugly but at least it’s clear what’s happening. The
ultimate goal is to maintain this level of readability without sacrificing good
code style.

Better yet, what if there was a way to somehow run all of these steps in
parallel, rather than waiting for each to complete in turn. But wait, there
_is_ a way!


## Enter the Promise

Promises make the whole process of waiting for asynchronous events cleaner and
easier by abstracting the problem. Instead of nesting our functions we convert
them into Promise objects that can be chained together.

A Promise object is created by running the following:


    var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // Our condition here
    });


A Promise object can exist in one of three states; _pending_, _resolved_, or
_rejected_. Since our Promise doesn’t do anything, `myPromise` is _pending_.

The arguments supplied to our anonymous function, `resolve` and `reject` are
functions. The idea is to use these to change the state of our Promise when
the asynchronous operation is complete. Let’s look at some code.

In this example we’ll use `setTimeout` to wait three seconds before resolving
`myPromise` with the string `'Hello, world!'`:


    var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // Wait three seconds before resolving
      setTimeout(function() {
        resolve('Hello, world');
      }, 3000)
    });


This works, but it doesn’t do very much. `myPromise` changes state but we
need to specify what happens when the promise is resolved. To do this we pass
a function to the `then` method of `myPromise`:


    var myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        resolve('Hello, world');
      }, 3000)
    });

    // Do something when the promise gets resolved
    myPromise.then(function(value) {
      console.log(value);
    });


The beauty of using Promises is that we can add multiple `then` methods, and
at any point.

In the example above we could call `myPromise.then` many times with
different callback functions and each will be called. It also doesn’t
matter what state the Promise is when we add a `then`. If the Promise is
_pending_ the new callback will be added to the queue; if it’s already
_resolved_ the callback will be executed immediately.

_While the functions passed to `Promise()` are executed in a synchronous
manner, functions passed to `then()` are executed on the next ‘tick’ – the
equivalent of `setTimeout(..., 0)` – even if the Promise status is resolved._


## Handling rejection

As well as handling success where `resolve` is called, Promises can also handle
failure with the `reject`. Lets look at how we can handle rejection with a more
useful example.

Lets say we want to include an external JavaScript library in our page
dynamically. In order to use the library we need to wait for it to load, which
we can do by listening for it’s `load` event to fire. Here’s how that might
look using Promises:


    function loadScript(url) {
      var scriptPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        // Create a new script tag
        var script = document.createElement('script');
        // Use the url argument as source attribute
        script.src = url;

        // Call resolve when it’s loaded
        script.addEventListener('load', function() {
          resolve(url);
        }, false);

        // Add it to the body
        document.body.appendChild(script);
      });

      // Return the Promise
      return scriptPromise;
    }

    // Load a script
    loadScript('/path/to/script.js').then(function(value) {
      // Resolved
      console.log('Script loaded from:', value);
    });


This works, but it doesn’t handle the case where the script is not found. To
do this we can call the `reject` function from the Promise callback, in
the same way that we call `resolve` on successful completion.

Finally, we can add a second anonymous function argument to the `then`
method to specify what we do in the event of a rejection. Here’s the
updated code:


    function loadScript(url, success, failure) {
      var scriptPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        // Create a new script tag
        var script = document.createElement('script');
        // Use the url argument as source attribute
        script.src = url;

        // Call resolve when it’s loaded
        script.addEventListener('load', function() {
          resolve(url);
        }, false);

        // Reject the promise if there’s an error
        script.addEventListener('error', function() {
          reject(url);
        }, false);

        // Add it to the body
        document.body.appendChild(script);
      });

      scriptPromise
    }

    // Load a script
    loadScript('/path/to/script.js').then(function(value) {
      // Resolved
      console.log('Script loaded from:', value);
    }, function(value) {
      // Rejected
      console.error('Script not found:', value)
    });


There is a `catch` method which works similarly to the `then` method except
only takes a single `rejected` callback. Use of this method is not recommended
when using the ES6 Promise polyfill due to IE8 and below regarding `catch` as
a reserved keyword.


## Promises in series

Awesome! So what if we want to add more than one external JavaScript library in
our example? Well thanks to the fact that our `loadScript` function returns
a Promise object, we can take advantage of the chainable nature of `then`.

Unless a return is specified, the `then` method will return a copy of the
original Promise allowing multiple `then` callbacks to be triggered at once.
This can be overridden by returning a new Promise which allows a chain of
conditions to be specified in series.

Using the `loadScript` function we defined above, we can do the following:


    loadScript('/path/to/script-1.js').then(function() {
      return loadScript('/path/to/script-2.js');
    }).then(function() {
      return loadScript('/path/to/script-3.js');
    }).then(function() {
      return loadScript('/path/to/script-4.js');
    }).then(function() {
      console.log('Loaded!');
    });


This will load each script followed by our final callback, all without
resorting to callback hell. If the scripts have to be loaded in strict
sequence, then this is unfortunately as far as we can go. However if each
script was an independent _module_ and the loading order didn’t matter, we
could take things a step further. Lets assume we can.


## Going parallel

The final benefit we stand to gain from Promises is to fulfil all of our
Promise requests at once. That way we can resolve all of our Promises in
parallel instead of waiting for each to resolve in turn.

`Promise.all` and `Promise.race` are static methods that each take an Array
of Promises as an argument, returning a new Promise. Both methods will watch
the Array but with one important difference; `Promise.all` will resolve when
_all_ of the Promises in the Array have resolved, whereas `Promise.race` will
resolve as soon as _any one_ Promise in the Array has resolved.

Since we want to wait till all of our scripts have loaded, we need to use
`Promise.all`. We need to refactor our `loadScript` function a bit to
accommodate this change. For reusability I’ve chosen to rewrite it as a
reusable `ScriptLoader` object.


    function ScriptLoader() {

      var promises = [];

      this.add = function(url) {
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

          var script = document.createElement('script');
          script.src = url;

          script.addEventListener('load', function() {
            resolve(script);
          }, false);

          script.addEventListener('error', function() {
            reject(script);
          }, false);

          document.body.appendChild(script);
        });

        promises.push(promise);
      };

      this.loaded = function(callback) {
        Promise.all(promises).then(callback);
      };
    }

    var loader = new ScriptLoader();

    loader.add('/path/to/script-1.js');
    loader.add('/path/to/script-2.js');
    loader.add('/path/to/script-3.js');
    loader.add('/path/to/script-4.js');

    loader.loaded(function(returned) {
      console.log('Loaded!');
    });


## Wrapping up

And there we have it. If you’d like to read more about Promises and see more
code examples, I highly recommend Jake Archibald’s excellent article on HTML5
Rocks called [JavaScript Promises: There and back again][h5rocks]. There’s
also great documentation available on the [Mozilla Developer Network][mdn], and
finally the open [Promises/A+][aplus] standard itself.
