This year is my father’s 50th birthday. To celebrate we’re attempting the
[Coast to Coast Walk][coast-to-coast] which will take us across the United
Kingdom – from Whitehaven in Cumbria, to Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire.

The two hundred mile journey should take us fourteen days and was first
popularised by [Alfred Wainright][wainwright]. During this time we will pass
through three national parks – the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales and the
North York Moors.
