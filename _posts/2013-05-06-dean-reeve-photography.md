This month I [completed a website][dean-link] for a friend of mine. Dean Reeve is an excellent photographer and cyclist from the North East of England, so when he asked if I could build him a website I was happy to oblige.

Dean was keen to establish an online presence with a portfolio and blog. It was clear from early on that the ability to update the site on the move would be essential to staying ahead of his competition. With this in mind I designed and built him a site using WordPress. Dean is an iPhone user so I was able to recommended the excellent WordPress app that allows composing blog posts on the go.

Dean was already uploading his photos to a [Flickr account][dean-flickr]. By using the Flickr API I was able to build a portfolio that pulls the latest photos and sets through so he doesn't need to upload his photos to two websites. Hopefully, this means Dean can keep his website up-to-date without changing his workflow.

Anyway, website details aside, you should really [check him out][dean-link] â€“ I'm no photographer, but his work is amazing.
