title: Fixing npm

I work with [npm][npm] daily on OS X and occasionally run into permission errors and various `npm: ERR` outputs when installing or updating modules.

Here’s what I use to fix `npm` when it needs a hand (on OS X, YMMV). Note: these commands use `sudo` – don’t blindly trust me, read ahead before you copy and paste.

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh

# Make sure cache dirs are owned by you
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local 
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.npm

# Clean npm’s cache
sudo npm cache clean

# Update npm
sudo npm -g update
{% endhighlight %}
