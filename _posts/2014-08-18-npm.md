title: Don’t run npm -g update

I’ve learnt my lesson.

Coming at npm from a linux package management background, I expected to be able to run `npm -g update` to upgrade all my globally installed modules. This is not a good idea in npm land.

I used to have (in an old version of this post, no less) a script that would run `brew upgrade` and `npm -g update` together, and I was plagued by failed installations and permissions errors.

The reason this command fails so frequently is that `npm -g update` will also update npm itself to the latest unstable version. The correct way to update npm (on it’s own) to the latest *stable* version is to run `npm -g update npm@latest`.

If you want to find which global packages need updating, use `npm outdated -g --depth=0` and then update each one manually with `npm update -g <package>`.
