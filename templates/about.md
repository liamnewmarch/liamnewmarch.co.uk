# About

My name is Liam Newmarch and I’m a <insert-age date-of-birth="1987/12/01">twenty-odd</insert-age> year old web developer. I live in London and work for a company called [Potato](https://p.ota.to) where I make things for Google.


# Quick history

I’m originally from Stockton-on-Tees in the North East of England – home of the friction match, the first passenger railway, and the chicken parmo.

In 2007 I moved to study New Media at the University of Leeds, where I would later meet my fiancé. A month before I graduated, I interned at [WPA Pinfold](http://wpa-pinfold.co.uk) before joining as a PHP developer. In my three years at WPA I rose to become lead developer and oversaw the development of numerous PHP sites.

In 2014 I left Leeds for the bright lights of London. I joined [Potato](https://p.ota.to) as a contract front end developer, working on a large scale Django / App Engine application for Google.
