If you have anything you’d like to discuss publicly, it’s probably best that you <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=2172321700">send me a tweet</a>. Most of my projects are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/liamnewmarch">GitHub</a>, and I also lurk <a href="https://plus.google.com/liamnewmarch">Google+</a>.

If you really need to talk to me privately, you can email me directly. Recruitment agencies please note I won’t reply to unsolicited emails.
