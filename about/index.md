# About

My name is Liam Newmarch and I’m a <insert-age date-of-birth="1987/12/01">twenty-odd</insert-age> year old web developer. I live in London and work for a company called [Potato](https://p.ota.to).

I’m originally from Stockton-on-Tees in the North East of England but left in 2007 to study New Media at the University of Leeds.

I joined [WPA Pinfold](http://wpa-pinfold.co.uk) as a PHP developer in 2010, a month before I graduated. I spent three years working for WPA, rising from an intern to lead developer.

In 2014 I left Leeds and WPA for the bright lights of London and joined [Potato](https://p.ota.to), where I mostly work on front end things.
